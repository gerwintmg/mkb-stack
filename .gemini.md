# Gemini Guidelines for mkb-stack

This file provides guidelines for Gemini when interacting with the mkb-stack project.

## Project Overview

mkb-stack is a project that uses Ansible to manage a set of services running in Incus containers. The project includes scripts for bootstrapping the host and containers.

## Key Files

*   `Makefile`: Contains the main entry points for bootstrapping and applying the configuration.
*   `scripts/host-setup.sh`: Sets up the host machine.
*   `scripts/bootstrap.sh`: Sets up the Incus containers.
*   `ansible/inventories/hosts.yml`: Defines the Ansible inventory.
*   `ansible/inventories/group_vars/all.yml`: Defines global Ansible variables.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Bootstrap:** The `make bootstrap` command is used to set up the development environment. This should be run before making any changes.
2.  **Apply:** The `make apply` command is used to apply the Ansible configuration. Note that the Ansible roles and playbooks are not included in this repository.

*   Answering questions about the project.
