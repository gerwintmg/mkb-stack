# Gemini Guidelines for mkb-stack

This file provides guidelines for Gemini when interacting with the mkb-stack project.

## Project Overview

mkb-stack is a template for small businesses to set up their internal IT infrastructure using open-source software. It uses Ansible to manage services running in Incus containers on a single server. The project prioritizes security, stability, and compatibility with various client operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Project Philosophy

*   **Independence:** Empower small businesses to own and control their IT infrastructure.
*   **Open Source:** Use and promote open-source software with permissive licenses.
*   **Security:** Isolate services in containers to minimize the impact of security incidents.
*   **Compatibility:** Ensure services work with a variety of client devices.

## Key Files

*   `Makefile`: Contains the main entry points for bootstrapping and applying the configuration.
*   `scripts/host-setup.sh`: Sets up the host machine.
*   `scripts/bootstrap.sh`: Sets up the Incus containers.
*   `ansible/inventories/hosts.yml`: Defines the Ansible inventory.
*   `ansible/inventories/group_vars/all.yml`: Defines global Ansible variables.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Bootstrap:** The `make bootstrap` command is used to set up the development environment. This should be run before making any changes.
2.  **Apply:** The `make apply` command is used to apply the Ansible configuration. Note that the Ansible roles and playbooks are not included in this repository.
